# WebMap-Slope-Inclination-and-SnowCard-Algorithm
This project is about creating an interactive, web-based map that integrates and visualizes slope inclinations and snow conditions predicted by the SnowCard Algorithm. The application, built using the Leaflet JavaScript library, will provide a comprehensive view of the terrain and potential snow-related risks
